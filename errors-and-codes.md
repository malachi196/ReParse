## Errors and Error Codes: Common ReParse Errors and What They Mean
This is a guide on how to enterprit errors that may occur when running ReParse on applications. \
If you get another error that is not on here, please [start an issue](https://github.com/malachi196/ReParse/issues/new)

### general error codes: 1 and -1
These errors usually refer to the fact that the program may have ran incorrectly, and something is wrong.
Unfortunetely, this is a very wide group, meaning that the errors could mean nearly anything. \
Some of the most common of these errors are:
 - **Permission Error**: the program attempted to run needs admin recources, and will not cooperate with ReParse. This is not fixable, and is not what ReParse is meant to be used for.
    If you want to use ReParse, make sure the program you want to run does not actually use admin resources. **Characteristics:** This error is usually distinguishable by the fact that a "perm error box might appear
    from the application you where trying to run.
 - **Program was closed by user**: this is not an error. ReParse is not able to distinguish some minor differences, so do not worry about it. **Characteristics:** Usually, the user clicks
   the exit button, but the program might also close automatically.
 - **Program ran into an error**: the program you are running encountered an internal error. **Characteristics***: the program you are using will most likely display an error message
