# ReParse
Made for attempting to run applications without having admin permisions, by \
trying to verify run access without admin resources!

## Important Disclaimers
+ ReParse does NOT boost an application to admin permision!!! This means programs that need admin to function will NOT work with ReParse, but rather programs that need RUNTIME VERIFICATION are able to function with ReParse standards. More information at (add info-section link here)


## Release Details
- **ReParse.bat** is the **original file**, programmed in batch cmd 
- **Reparse.py** is the **python version** (under maintenence)
